          <h2>About GRHA</h2>
			<p> Georgia Rural Health Association (GRHA) is the oldest state rural health association in the country. 
			Founded in 1981, this nonprofit network of healthcare providers, educators, and individuals is united in its 
			commitment to improve the health and healthcare services of rural Georgians. GRHA understands that the rural 
			areas in our state are unique and differ greatly from urban areas in our state. These rural communities, and 
			those who provide healthcare services to them, require educational programs and support tailored to their specific needs.</p>	
			<br />
